Notepad
-------

The application has a built-in notepad, divided into several tabs. This can be useful for storing information in a convenient way, without the need to open an external text editor. The content of the notepad is automatically saved whenever the content changes.

Painter
-------

Using the ``Painter`` tool, you can create quick sketches and submit them to the model for analysis. You can also edit open or camera-captured images, for example, by adding elements like arrows or outlines to objects. Additionally, you can capture screenshots from the system - the captured image is placed in the drawing tool and attached to the query being sent.

Using the calendar, you can go back to selected conversations from a specific day and add daily notes. After adding a note, it will be marked on the list, and you can change the color of its label by right-clicking and selecting ``Set label color`` option. By clicking on a particular day of the week, conversations from that day will be displayed.

An audio transcription tool with which you can prepare a transcript from a video or audio file. It will use a speech recognition plugin to generate the text from the file.


Python Code Interpreter
-----------------------

This tool allows you to run Python code directly from within the app. It is integrated with the ``Code Interpreter`` plugin, ensuring that code generated by the model is automatically available from the interpreter. In the plugin settings, you can enable the execution of code in a Docker environment.


HTML/JS Canvas
