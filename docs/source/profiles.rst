Profiles
=========

You can create multiple profiles for an app and switch between them. Each profile uses its own configuration, settings, context history, and a separate folder for user files. This allows you to set up different environments and quickly switch between them, changing the entire setup with just one click.

The app lets you create new profiles, edit existing ones, and duplicate current ones.

To create a new profile, select the option from the menu: ``Config -> Profile -> New Profile...``

To edit saved profiles, choose the option from the menu: ``Config -> Profile -> Edit Profiles...``

To switch to a created profile, pick the profile from the menu: ``Config -> Profile -> [Profile Name]``

Each profile uses its own user directory (workdir). You can link a newly created or edited profile to an existing workdir with its configuration.

The name of the currently active profile is shown as (Profile Name) in the window title.
