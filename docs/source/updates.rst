Updating PyGPT
---------------
**PyGPT** comes with an integrated update notification system. When a new version with additional features is released, you'll receive an alert within the app. 

To get the new version, simply download it and start using it in place of the old one. All your custom settings like configuration, presets, indexes, and past conversations will be kept and ready to use right away in the new version.
