Presets
========

What is preset?
----------------
Presets in **PyGPT** are essentially templates used to store and quickly apply different configurations. Each preset includes settings for the mode you want to use (such as chat, completion, or image generation), an initial system prompt, an assigned name for the AI, a username for the session, and the desired "temperature" for the conversation. A warmer "temperature" setting allows the AI to provide more creative responses, while a cooler setting encourages more predictable replies. These presets can be used across various modes and with models accessed via the ``OpenAI API`` or ``LangChain``.

The application lets you create as many presets as needed and easily switch among them. Additionally, you can clone an existing preset, which is useful for creating variations based on previously set configurations and experimentation.
